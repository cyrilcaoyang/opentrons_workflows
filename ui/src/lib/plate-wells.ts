/**
 * Per-well state for the selected deck slot — the model both inspector views
 * render.
 *
 * Two different truths arrive keyed by well id and are unified here:
 *
 * - **Tip racks** get their state from `details.tip_racks[nickname].tips`
 *   (the gateway's `TipStateStore`). That map lists only *non-fresh* wells, so
 *   absence means fresh — never "unknown".
 * - **Plates** get theirs from the slot labware's own `wells`, the
 *   orchestrator-tracked samples the deck folds onto the slot.
 *
 * The join key is the slot's `nickname` (stamped by `build_deck` so it survives
 * run/REPL precedence), not `display_name`, which the robot overwrites with its
 * own label.
 *
 * A rack the gateway has never registered is **`untracked`**, deliberately
 * distinct from "full": nothing has claimed those tips, but nothing has
 * confirmed them either, and drawing 96 fresh tips for a rack the tracker has
 * never seen is the lie this state exists to avoid.
