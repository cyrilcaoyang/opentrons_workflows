# Tailscale on the Opentrons robots

How `tailscaled` is installed and kept running on the robots' Buildroot /
OT3 system, and how to upgrade it. Both the OT-2 and the Flex have a **read-only root filesystem**,
no package manager, no `nano` (use `vi`), and no TUN driver, so Tailscale runs
as a static binary from the persistent `/data` partition in
**userspace-networking** mode, started by a small systemd unit.

Both robots follow this layout. Neither gateway *depends* on it for control
any more (see `DEVICE_BRINGUP.md` *Network paths*): HTE is reached by wire,
Complexation through the UPLC PC USB bridge. Tailscale on the robot is for
SSH access (`tailscale up --ssh`) and for the Opentrons App.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/data/tailscale_<ver>_arm/` | one directory per installed version (`tailscaled`, `tailscale`) |
| `/data/tailscale` | **symlink to the active version** — everything else refers to this, so an upgrade is a symlink swap |
| `/data/start_tailscale.sh` | boot script: starts `tailscaled` if not running, then `tailscale up --ssh` |
| `/etc/systemd/system/tailscale-autostart.service` | oneshot unit that runs the script after `network-online.target` |
| `/var/lib/tailscale/tailscaled.state` | node identity + prefs (persists across reboots; **never delete** or the robot becomes a new machine and needs re-auth + re-tagging) |
| `/tmp/tailscaled.log`, `/tmp/tailscale-up.log`, `/tmp/tailscale-watch.log` | logs, volatile |

Architecture: the **OT-2** (Raspberry Pi 3B+, `armv7l`) takes the 32-bit
**`arm`** build; the **Flex** (`aarch64`) takes **`arm64`**. Check `uname -m`
before downloading.

Installs before 2026-09 hard-coded `/data/tailscale_1.82.0_arm/` in the
script; the symlink layout replaces that. If a robot still has the old
script, the upgrade below rewrites it.

## Fresh install

1. On your computer, fetch the latest static build and verify it:

   ```bash
   V=$(curl -s https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ | grep -o 'tailscale_[0-9.]*_arm\.tgz' | sort -uV | tail -1 | sed 's/tailscale_\(.*\)_arm.tgz/\1/')
   curl -O https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/tailscale_${V}_arm.tgz
   curl -s https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/tailscale_${V}_arm.tgz.sha256; echo; sha256sum tailscale_${V}_arm.tgz
   scp -i ~/.ssh/ot2_ssh_key -O tailscale_${V}_arm.tgz root@<robot>:/data/
   ```

2. On the robot (`ssh -i ~/.ssh/ot2_ssh_key root@<robot>`):

   ```sh
   cd /data && tar -xzf tailscale_${V}_arm.tgz && ln -sfn /data/tailscale_${V}_arm /data/tailscale
   /data/tailscale/tailscaled --tun=userspace-networking > /tmp/tailscaled.log 2>&1 &
   sleep 5
   /data/tailscale/tailscale up --ssh
   ```

   Open the printed URL, authenticate, then in the Tailscale admin console
   tag the new machine `tag:tailscale-SSH` (and `tagged-devices` like its
   siblings). Test `ssh root@<tailnet-ip>` before continuing.

3. Boot script, `/data/start_tailscale.sh` (`/data` is writable, no remount).
   This is the version deployed on both robots on 2026-09-06; every line of
   the comment block was earned by an outage (see *Traps*).

   ```sh
   #!/bin/sh
   # Started by tailscale-autostart.service (Type=oneshot, RemainAfterExit).
   #  * pidof, not ps|grep: any shell whose argv mentions the daemon name would
   #    otherwise trip the check and the daemon would never start.
   #  * This script must ALWAYS exit 0. A failed oneshot makes systemd kill the
   #    unit's whole cgroup -- the daemon included.
   #  * `tailscale up` is only needed for the first login; prefs (WantRunning,
   #    --ssh) live in /var/lib/tailscale/tailscaled.state and the daemon
   #    reconnects on its own. So its outcome is logged, never fatal.
   TS=/data/tailscale
   LOG=/tmp/tailscale-watch.log
   if ! pidof tailscaled > /dev/null; then
       echo "$(date) starting tailscaled" >> $LOG
       nohup $TS/tailscaled --tun=userspace-networking > /tmp/tailscaled.log 2>&1 &
       i=0
       while [ $i -lt 30 ] && [ ! -S /var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock ]; do i=$((i+1)); sleep 1; done
       if $TS/tailscale up --ssh --timeout=60s >> /tmp/tailscale-up.log 2>&1; then
           echo "$(date) tailscale up ok" >> $LOG
       else
           echo "$(date) tailscale up rc=$? -- daemon left running, will reconnect on its own" >> $LOG
       fi
   else
       echo "$(date) tailscaled already running" >> $LOG
   fi
   exit 0
   ```

   `chmod +x /data/start_tailscale.sh`

4. systemd unit. `/etc` is on the read-only root, so remount once; a reboot
   restores read-only automatically.

   ```sh
   mount -o remount,rw /
   vi /etc/systemd/system/tailscale-autostart.service
   ```

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Start tailscaled on boot
   Wants=network-online.target
   After=network-online.target

   [Service]
   Type=oneshot
   ExecStart=/data/start_tailscale.sh
   RemainAfterExit=yes

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   ```sh
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl enable tailscale-autostart.service
   systemctl start tailscale-autostart.service
   mount -o remount,ro /
   ```

5. Verify: `/data/tailscale/tailscale status`,
   `systemctl status tailscale-autostart.service`, then reboot and watch the
   machine go offline → connected in the admin console.

## Upgrade (keeps the node identity, no re-auth)

Identity lives in `/var/lib/tailscale/tailscaled.state`, not in the binary
directory, so swapping binaries is safe. Order matters: stop the daemon
before replacing the symlink; the new daemon reads the same state file.

```sh
# on the robot, after scp'ing the new tgz to /data/
cd /data && tar -xzf tailscale_${V}_arm.tgz
killall tailscaled; sleep 2
ln -sfn /data/tailscale_${V}_arm /data/tailscale
/data/start_tailscale.sh          # restarts the daemon via the symlink
/data/tailscale/tailscale version
/data/tailscale/tailscale status | head -3
rm -rf /data/tailscale_<old>_arm /data/tailscale_${V}_arm.tgz   # once the new one is confirmed up
```

The SSH session you are in survives if you came in over the wired or USB
path. If you came in over Tailscale SSH, expect the session to drop at
`pkill` and reconnect ~10 s later; the boot unit is not involved, but running
the script by hand is exactly what it would do.

## Per-robot `up` flags

The `tailscale up` line is not identical on every robot, and `up` refuses to
run if you drop a flag that is already in the saved prefs (it asks for
`--reset`). Keep each robot's line when rewriting the script:

| robot | `up` flags |
|---|---|
| HTE, Flex | `--ssh` |
| Complexation | `--ssh --advertise-tags=tag:sdl2-devices,tag:tailscale-ssh --accept-dns=false --hostname=sdl2-ot2-training` |

`--accept-dns=false` is worth adopting everywhere at the next touch: in
userspace-networking mode the robot gains nothing from MagicDNS and it keeps
Tailscale out of `resolv.conf`. `--hostname` is why the tailnet shows
`sdl2-ot2-training` while the registry calls it `sdl2-ot2-complexation`.

## Traps

- **The OT-2's Wi-Fi chip wedges, and it is a driver fault, not the campus
  network.** Observed directly on HTE 2026-09-06: NetworkManager still says
  `wlan0: connected`, but `dmesg` fills with
  `brcmfmac: brcmf_proto_bcdc_msg failed w/status -110`, `iw dev wlan0 link`
  times out, ARP to the gateway stays `INCOMPLETE`, and no packet passes.
  Complexation shows the end stage of the same fault (`wlan0` disconnected,
  empty scan). **Recovery without a reboot**, over the wired/USB path:

  ```sh
  modprobe -r brcmfmac; sleep 3; modprobe brcmfmac; sleep 10
  nmcli con up compsci
  ```

  Wi-Fi was back and `tailscaled` reconnected on its own within a minute.
  This is what to try on Complexation from the UPLC PC before power-cycling
  it. Do **not** `nmcli con down compsci` first — it is not needed, and it
  leaves the profile inactive so the following `up` has to name it
  explicitly.

- **A non-zero exit from the boot script kills the daemon.** When a
  `Type=oneshot` unit's `ExecStart` fails, systemd stops the unit and kills
  everything left in its cgroup — the `nohup`'d `tailscaled` included. The
  original script ended with a bare `tailscale up --ssh`, so any `up` failure
  (control plane unreachable at boot, the 60 s timeout, a DNS blip) took the
  daemon down with it. That is what killed HTE's Tailscale at every boot from
  2026-08-14 to 2026-09-06. The script now always exits 0 and only logs the
  `up` result; the daemon reconnects on its own once it has a route.
- **Start the daemon through the unit, never from your SSH session.** A
  `tailscaled` launched by hand (even with `nohup`) belongs to the login
  session and dies when that session ends. Use
  `systemctl restart tailscale-autostart.service` and confirm
  `systemctl status` lists `tailscaled` under the unit's `CGroup`.
- **The running-check must be `pidof`.** The original `ps | grep
  '[t]ailscaled'` also matched any shell whose command line mentioned the
  daemon (e.g. the very `ssh … 'killall tailscaled; systemctl restart …'`
  that was trying to fix it), so the script logged "already running" and
  started nothing. Busybox `ps` shows every process; this bit HTE, not the
  Flex.

- **A wired static config can black-hole the robot's internet.** HTE's
  `/etc/network/interfaces` (Buildroot `ifupdown`, runs before
  NetworkManager) gave `eth0` a `gateway 192.168.254.230` that does not
  exist on the lab switch. Being metric 0 it outranked the Wi-Fi default
  (metric 600), so *every* internet-bound packet was dropped: no NTP, no
  Tailscale control plane, `tailscale up` hanging at boot. The lab switch is
  on-link only — the gateway needs no default route there. Fixed 2026-09-06
  by deleting the `gateway` line (backup at `/data/interfaces.bak-20260906`);
  the robot's internet is its Wi-Fi. Symptom to recognise: `ping 1.1.1.1`
  fails but `ping -I wlan0 1.1.1.1` works.
- **`/etc` edits do not survive an Opentrons OS update** (A/B root
  partitions). After an update, re-create the unit (§Fresh install step 4)
  and re-check `/etc/network/interfaces`. `/data` and `/var/lib/tailscale`
  persist.
- **Tailscale SSH is gated by the tailnet ACL, not by `--ssh`.** `RunSSH:
  true` on the node is necessary but the admin console must also tag the
  machine (`tag:tailscale-ssh`) or the connection is refused with `tailnet
  policy does not permit you to SSH to this node`. All three robots were
  tagged 2026-09-06 — and the refusal persisted from the Cytation PC, whose
  daemon log line reads `failed to evaluate policy, result: rejected`. The
  **source** matters too: the Cytation PC is itself a tagged device
  (`sdl2-pc-03-cytation`, `tag:sdl2-devices`), and an `ssh` ACL rule whose
  `src` is `autogroup:member` admits users, not tagged machines. To SSH
  robot-to-robot or from a device PC, the rule needs that tag in `src`;
  from a person's laptop it should already work. Key-based `sshd` on port 22
  over the tailnet address works regardless and is what the `*_tailscale`
  aliases in `~/.ssh/config` use.
- No `pkill` and no `timeout` on the OT-2; use `killall`, and run long probes
  under a client-side `timeout` in the `ssh` command. On the Flex, `route` and
  `ip` live in `/sbin`, which a non-login `ssh` command does not have on `PATH`.
- **The live route can differ from the file.** The Flex had `gateway
  192.168.254.230` in `/etc/network/interfaces` but `192.168.254.1` in the
  kernel table (the file had been edited after a 162-day-old boot). Always
  read `route -n` / `ip route` and delete the route that is actually there.
  The Flex's Wi-Fi interface is `mlan0`, not `wlan0`.

## Reaching each robot for this

| robot | path that does not depend on Tailscale | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ot2_hte` (`ot2cytation`) | `ssh ot2_local` → `root@192.168.254.50`, lab switch | key `~/.ssh/ot2_ssh_key` (passphrase-protected; load it into `ssh-agent` first) |
| Flex (`sdl2-otflex-01`) | `ssh otflex_local` → `root@192.168.254.81`, lab switch | same key |
| `ot2_complexation` (`ot2training`) | `ssh -J sdl2@100.64.254.19 root@169.254.40.81` — the USB-B link, jumping through the UPLC PC | the robot key is authorized on the UPLC PC (`administrators_authorized_keys`, 2026-09-06). Direct from the Cytation PC there is no route; the bridge forwards port 31950 only. |
