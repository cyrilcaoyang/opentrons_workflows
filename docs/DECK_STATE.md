# OT-2 Deck / Labware State — feature documentation

**Status:** shipped and deployed. Phases 0–2 landed in this repo (commit
`ede0a85`); the dashboard side (tile reading the device deck, `deck.declare`
SkillDef) shipped in `ac-organic-lab`. Both gateways (`ot2_hte` :8020,
`ot2_complexation` :8021) deployed 2026-07-10 and verified live; the old
dashboard stopgap layouts were migrated into the gateways' declared stores.
HTTP-transport deck parity (including idle-persistence across restart) was
hardware-validated 2026-07-14 — see
[`HTTP_DRIVE_VALIDATION.md`](HTTP_DRIVE_VALIDATION.md). Tip-rack registration
was rekeyed onto the deck slot 2026-08-07 (`4a7faf3`) and extended to gateway
boot (`6c46e57`); both gateways redeployed and verified live the same day.

> This document replaces the retired **`DECK_STATE_PLAN.md`** (the phased

> workflow repos.

**What it is:** a normalized deck/labware state layer in the gateway
(`gateway/deck.py` + models in `gateway/models.py`) that unifies the
previously-orphaned state stores and publishes `details.snapshot.deck` on
`/status` — the single deck picture the dashboard tile and the full-page OT-2
control interface render.

---

## The model

### Labware kind enum

Derived from the Opentrons `load_name` (which is highly structured:
`<brand>_<count>_<category>_<...>`), never hand-set:

```python
LabwareKind = Literal[
    "96-well", "384-well", "48-well", "24-well", "12-well", "6-well",
    "well_plate",   # a wellPlate whose grid isn't one of the named sizes
    "tiprack", "reservoir", "tuberack", "trash", "adapter", "unknown",
]
```

`classify_labware(load_name, ...)` returns `(kind, rows, columns)`; the
12-count ambiguity (12-reservoir = 1×12 vs 12-wellplate = 3×4) is resolved by
the category token. The dashboard renders generically off `rows`/`columns`;
`kind` only drives label/icon/greying.

### Slot / deck models

```python
class SlotLabware(BaseModel):
    kind: LabwareKind
    load_name: str
    display_name: Optional[str] = None
    is_tiprack: bool = False
    rows: Optional[int] = None
    columns: Optional[int] = None
    # present only for the tracked plate (from PlateStateStore); None otherwise
    plate_id: Optional[str] = None
    wells: Optional[List[WellSample]] = None

class SlotModule(BaseModel):
    module_name: str
    status: Optional[str] = None
    serial_number: Optional[str] = None

SlotState = Literal["empty", "declared", "occupied", "in_use", "mismatch"]
DeckSource = Literal["run", "repl", "declared", "empty"]

class DeckSlot(BaseModel):
    labware: Optional[SlotLabware] = None
    module: Optional[SlotModule] = None
    slot_state: SlotState = "empty"
    source: DeckSource = "empty"
    declared: Optional[SlotLabware] = None        # the declaration on this slot, whatever won
    declared_module: Optional[SlotModule] = None  # ditto, when the declaration is a module

class DeckState(BaseModel):
    source: DeckSource            # highest-precedence source contributing any slot
    slots: Dict[str, DeckSlot]    # "1".."12", always all 12 keys present
    timestamp: datetime
```

## Sources and merge semantics

`build_deck(...)` is a pure function (no hardware, no I/O) merging four
sources with precedence **run > repl > declared > empty**:

- **run** — the robot-server run's loaded labware (the active external run
  probe on SSH; the gateway's own never-played run on the HTTP transport —
  see [`HTTP_TRANSPORT.md`](HTTP_TRANSPORT.md)). TTL-cached; never fetched
  from the `/status` handler.
- **repl** — the SSH REPL snapshot (`state_readers.get_all_states`), present
  only while the gateway owns a REPL session. Empty on the HTTP transport.
- **declared** — operator/recipe intent: the persisted
  `DeckDeclarationStore` (`OT2_DECK_STATE_PATH`) merged with the
  `session_recipe` from `/control/setup`.
- **empty** — the fallback.

**Only `declared` survives a restart.** `run` and `repl` are session-scoped —
the run probe's cache and the REPL snapshot both die with the process — so a
deck that was *only ever observed* comes back `empty` after a service restart
and stays that way until the next protocol loads labware. Declaring is what
makes a layout durable, which matters most on a robot whose deck is set up by
hand rather than by a `/control/setup` recipe. Observed live 2026-08-07:
restarting `ot2_hte` blanked a deck that had only ever been observed, while
`ot2_complexation`'s declared deck came back intact. Note the direction of the
precedence — declaring can never override what a run observes, so declaring a
hand-set deck is safe even while protocols come and go.

### Slot-state decision table

Let `observed = run[s] or repl[s]` (run wins), `declared = declared[s]`,
`busy` = service BUSY or an active run:

| observed | declared | kinds agree? | `slot_state` | `source` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | — | `empty` | `empty` |
| — | ✓ | — | `declared` | `declared` |
| ✓ | — | — | `in_use` if busy else `occupied` | run/repl |
| ✓ | ✓ | yes | `in_use` if busy else `occupied` | run/repl |
| ✓ | ✓ | **no** | `mismatch` (`labware`=observed, `declared`=the losing intent) | run/repl |

This declared-vs-observed reconciliation is the contract the workflow repos
asked for: declaring records *intent* (pure metadata, no hardware); the robot
observation wins on conflict, and the disagreement is flagged per slot rather
than silently resolved.

`slot_state` is therefore about the *slot*, not about the declaration: rows 4
and 5 both hold a declaration while saying `occupied`. So the declaration is
reported separately, on **every** declared slot, in `declared` (labware) or
`declared_module` (a sticky module) — not only on the mismatch row. Anything
reconstructing the declared layout must read those two fields. `slot_state`
alone loses every slot the robot has loaded, and because
`POST /control/deck/declare` is a full-layout replace, re-sending a layout built
that way **deletes** those declarations device-side. That was live for the
panel until 2026-08-19: a declared custom plate used by one successful run
became unclearable in the UI and was then wiped — definition included — by the
next unrelated declare, which brought back the `FileNotFoundError` that
auto-loading a custom plate without its definition raises. The
orchestrator-tracked plate is excluded from both fields: it is folded onto its
slot to carry its wells, not as operator intent.

## Store unification (no parallel structures)

- **`PlateStateStore` is the single well-truth store.** `build_deck` reads it
  and attaches `plate_id` + `wells` onto the slot the tracked plate occupies
  (resolved by matching `plate_id` against `session_recipe` nicknames →
  location; an unmatched plate stays "unplaced" and is still emitted in
  `details.loaded_plate`).
- **`details.loaded_plate` is retained verbatim** for back-compat (the
  solubility workflow reads it directly) but is now derived from the same
  store the deck slot reads — deprecated in favour of the deck slots once
  consumers migrate.
- **`last_snapshot`** stays as the internal raw snapshot cache feeding the
  `repl` source (SSH) or the run-derived shape (HTTP — see the snapshot-shape
  section of [`HTTP_SSH_PARITY.md`](HTTP_SSH_PARITY.md)).

### Tip-rack registration follows the deck

`TipStateStore` is keyed by **deck slot**, not by a recipe nickname: a tip rack
carries no sample and no history worth naming, and what an operator points at —
and refills — is "the rack in slot 4" (`4a7faf3`). Registration happens at
three points, all non-destructive (a slot already tracked keeps its used-tip
statuses):

| When | Why |
|---|---|
| `/control/setup` | the recipe places tip racks |
| `/control/deck/declare` | declaring a rack *is* the fact the tracker needs — before this, a declared rack was invisible to the tracker |
| gateway boot (`OT2Service.__init__`) | the persisted deck outlives the process; without it a rack declared in an earlier session came back untracked (`6c46e57`) |

**Registration asserts a *full* rack.** `_fresh_rack` marks every well `new`,
so a count that came from registration alone is an assumption — "a rack
appeared on this slot, presume it is untouched" — not an observation. Three
things corroborate a count, in descending strength: pick/drop events (evidence
the gateway itself recorded), an operator `POST /control/tips/reset` (a human
asserting a physical refill or swap), and nothing at all. Treat a rack with no
history and no reset as unverified, however confident its `96/96` looks; the
device cannot see tips and will never correct itself. Registration is
deliberately non-destructive for the same reason — re-declaring or restarting
must never silently "refill" a rack that has been used.

**Clearing a declaration never touches tip state.** The two stores are
independent, and `TipStateStore.remove_rack` has no caller: undeclaring a slot
only hides its rack from the panel, and re-declaring brings the same used-tip
map back. That is the intended behaviour — declare/undeclare is layout
bookkeeping, and letting it reset a rack would make a full-layout replace
(`POST /control/deck/declare`) silently refill every rack it happened to omit.
Correcting a count is its own explicit act, never a side effect of a layout
edit.

Boot registration reads `_build_deck_state`, which is cache-only — no HTTP, no
REPL — so it cannot block or slow startup. It follows the *declared* deck by
construction, so a robot with no declared layout registers nothing at boot and
falls back to whatever the tip store itself persisted. That asymmetry is worth
knowing: the tip store and the deck can disagree after a restart, with the
store asserting racks the deck no longer shows.

The store and the deck are joined on the slot, which is why the join always
resolves — `labware.nickname` is `null` on every slot until a setup runs, and
keying on it was why a tracked rack could still render as untracked.

### A tip off the rack: `on_pipette` and the mount

A well holds one of four things: a fresh tip (`new`), a tip that has touched a
sample (the sample id), a bare hole (`empty`), or **`on_pipette`** — a hole
whose tip is on a head and may come back to it.

`on_pipette` is written **when the pick is issued**, not when the tip is
eventually thrown away. Before that, a rack went on claiming a tip that was
already riding the head until the run reached a `drop_tip`, with three
consequences: `/status` and the panel over-counted, `next_available` handed out
the *same* well again (sending the head back onto a hole it had just emptied),
and — the reported failure — returning the tip was refused as "would drop onto
a seated tip", so an interrupted run could not put its tip back without an
operator correction first.

The marking happens **before** the motion, and the two failure paths are
deliberately asymmetric:

| the pick | the rack | why |
|---|---|---|
| succeeds | stays `on_pipette` | the tip is on the head |
| fails definitely | rolled back to its prior status | nothing moved; restoring `new` wholesale would erase a returned tip's history, so the *prior* status is what comes back |
| ends unknown (transport loss) | stays `on_pipette`, mount flagged `uncertain` | assuming otherwise sends the next pick onto a well that may be a bare hole — a crash. A tip needlessly skipped is cheap; a head driven into a hole is not |

The tip's own history is **not** in the rack map while it is off the rack (the
well says only `on_pipette`). It lives on the pipette's `TipMount`, persisted
beside the racks and published at `details.mounted_tips`:

| field | answers |
|---|---|
| `rack` / `well` / `wells` | where it came from, so it can go back |
| `channels` | how many tips this one record speaks for |
| `contacted_liquid` | has it been in a real aspirate/dispense — the question asked before re-seating a tip |
| `last_sample` | what it touched most recently |
| `origin_status` | what the well read before the pick, so a return restores it |
| `picked_at` | when it came up |
| `uncertain` | the pick or drop never got a definite answer |

**Mounts are persisted, not session state.** A tip stays physically on the head
across a gateway restart, so the record of where it came from must too — held in
memory it was lost exactly when it was needed, and the tip was stranded: its
origin well no longer read as free and nothing recalled its exposure. On a
return, `last_sample` is written to the destination wells, so a tip that touched
a sample carries that history back into the rack, and one that never met liquid
returns as `new`.

`contacted_liquid` is set only by a real aspirate or dispense (`_mark_tip_used`)
and never inferred. Touching a tracked tiprack does not count as contact — which
is what lets a tip be picked, moved, and re-seated without being marked used.

### Correcting a count: reset vs mark

Two operator assertions, both claim-gated, both audited, neither inferable:

| endpoint | scope | says |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /control/tips/reset` | whole rack | "a fresh rack is in this slot" |
| `POST /control/tips/mark` | `wells` or whole `columns` | "*these* tips are present / gone" |

`tips/mark` exists because reset is all-or-nothing, so a rack that is genuinely
used in some columns and full in others could only be corrected by overstating
it — and an overstated rack sends the head onto bare holes. It sets only the
wells it names, and `set_statuses` validates the whole set before mutating any,
so a typo cannot leave a rack half-corrected.

**Columns and wells are different units for different jobs.** Columns are the
primary one: that is how an 8-channel head consumes a rack. Wells are the
*repair* unit — a tracker that has drifted by one tip needs two wells set to
**different** statuses ("A1 has a tip, B1 is the hole"), which no column
selection can express. The panel offers both (`TipEditor`, column mode by
default; it hides itself on any rack that is not 8 rows deep rather than
mislabelling which wells a click would touch). It shipped column-only, so the
one-well repair — the case a drifted tracker actually presents — had to be made
with a raw API call carrying a machine key, past both operator surfaces. The
endpoint always accepted `wells`; only the UI could not say it.

`status` is restricted to `new` | `empty`: **presence is assertable, contact is
not.** A *touched* tip carries the sample id it contacted, which is evidence the
gateway recorded during a real aspirate — so amber is a state the panel's column
editor reads but can never write.

**Both endpoints release any mount whose tips came from the wells they touch.**
An operator saying "there is a tip in A1" contradicts a mount claiming A1's tip
is on a head, as squarely as "A1 is a bare hole" contradicts a tip coming back
to it; leaving the mount would let the rack disagree with itself. Only the
bookkeeping is dropped — a tip physically on the head stays there, and dropping
it into the trash remains available. This is what makes `tips/mark` the recovery
path when the gateway and the bench disagree about what a head is holding.

Note `tips/reset`'s `wells` argument is *not* a partial reset — it redefines
which wells the rack has, all fresh. `{"slot": "4", "wells": ["A4"]}` leaves
slot 4 tracked as a one-well rack reporting `1/1`. Use `tips/mark` for a subset.

## Declared-layout endpoints

Control-class, claim-gated, audited when proxied through the dashboard's
`/control/*` passthrough:

- `POST /control/deck/declare` — body `{"slots": {"2": "<load_name>" |
  {"load_name"|"kind": ...} | null}}`; accepts full load-names (preferred) or
  the legacy kind-string shape; `null`/omitted clears a slot, empty `{}`
  clears all. POST (not PUT) so it flows through the dashboard passthrough
  and matches the SDK skill-catalog method set.
- `DELETE /control/deck/declare` — clear all.
- `deck.declare` is advertised in `allowed_actions` in every state except
  `EXTERNAL_CONTROL` (pure metadata, like `lights.set`).

**Hard constraint kept:** `GET /status` stays side-effect-free and fast —
`build_deck` runs inline over cached inputs only; no HTTP or REPL read ever
happens in the status path (enforced by test).

## Cross-repo state

- **Dashboard** (`ac-organic-lab`): `LiquidHandlerTile` and the full-page
  OT-2 control interface render `details.snapshot.deck` (declared and
  observed shown separately, mismatches badged ≠). The tile keeps a
  read-only legacy fallback to the old dashboard store for gateways that
  don't publish a deck yet; final deletion of the `api/app/deck.py` stopgap
  is tracked in that repo (`EQUIP_STATUS.md` §11). **That legacy store is
  stale and must not be used to seed a declaration** — for `ot2_hte` it still
  claims slot 7 is a 24-well plate, where the robot reports a 1000 µL tip
  rack.

**Deck view conventions.** `DeckPanel` exists in two copies — this repo's
`/ui` and the dashboard's tile — kept deliberately in step, so a change to one
is ported to the other (`6c46e57` here, `6b95e86` / `a35ad41` there):

- slot number in the cell's top-left corner, as bare text — a pill background
  there reads as an overlay covering A1;
- a `declared` slot carries a solid orange border, named **once** by a legend
  above the deck rather than by a badge on every slot (on a typical deck most
  slots are declared);
- `busy` / `≠` badges in the cell's top-right corner, in both variants;
- tip-rack wells tinted green (fresh) / amber (touched) / grey. A well whose
  tip is on a head reads as grey here too — at 2 px the useful question is "is
  there a tip in it", and *where it went* is the inspector's job (which draws it
  as a violet hollow ring, distinct from an `empty` hole). Grey covers
  both an emptied well *and* an untracked rack: "no tip" and "no idea" are
  both "do not count on it", and the tooltip carries the distinction. Green
  therefore means "known available", so a rack with no green is either spent
  or unregistered — both worth a closer look.
- The declared outline and legend are `page`-variant only. On the compact
  tile nearly every slot is declared, so outlining them all would say nothing
  while shouting.

**Editing a declaration takes two acts.** A slot that already declares
something cannot be re-declared in place: the picker's catalog and free-text
field go inert, only **Clear slot** stays live, and `ControlPanel.declare`
refuses a non-null entry for an already-declared slot. A declaration is not a
label — the gateway *auto-loads* labware from it — so a slot changed by a stray
click reaches the robot. **Clear all declared intent** likewise confirms before
firing, being the one declare action with no per-slot undo.
- **Workflow repos** consume `details.loaded_plate` (unchanged contract) and
  gain the per-slot deck + mismatch flags.
- **xArm** never reports placements — the OT-2 owns its own loaded truth;
  plate handoffs are recorded by the gateway per the handoff spec in
  [`HTTP_TRANSPORT.md`](HTTP_TRANSPORT.md).
