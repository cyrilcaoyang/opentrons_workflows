.SYNOPSIS
    One-screen preflight for the OT-2 gateways before a bench session.

.DESCRIPTION
    Reads /status from each gateway and prints the handful of fields an operator
    actually checks before touching a robot: health, whether anything is on a
    head, who holds the claim, and what the tip tracker believes about each
    rack. Read-only — it issues nothing but GETs, so it is safe at any time,
    including mid-run.

    It exists because those fields are scattered across a deep `details` blob,
    and the two that matter most are easy to miss:

    * `mounted tips` — a tip left on a head by an earlier run. The gateway now
      records this across restarts, so "none" here is a real answer rather than
      an absence of memory.
    * `channels` / `volumes` — the two pipette bindings, judged SEPARATELY
      because they resolve differently. Both come from the robot's instrument
      report, via a /control/setup recipe or (declared-deck flow) per-call by
      mount. `volumes` empty means the live per-pipette guard is genuinely
      inactive and only the 0-1000 uL schema bound applies. `channels` empty
      with a reachable probe is normal on a declared deck — mount-addressed
      picks still resolve; only a nickname-addressed pipette with no recipe
      falls back to 1 tip, which would track an 8-channel pick as one.
      The script spells out which case it is, because both are silent.

    Tip-rack counts are the tracker's memory, not an observation. The gateway
    cannot see a refill, so a count only means something if picks/drops or an
    explicit tips/reset put it there.

.PARAMETER Ports
    Gateway ports to probe. Defaults to both robots: 8020 (hte), 8021
    (complexation).

.PARAMETER BaseHost
    Host serving the gateways. Loopback by default, since this normally runs on
    the device PC itself.

    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ot2-preflight.ps1
