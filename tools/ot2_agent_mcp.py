"""MCP server exposing one OT-2 gateway to an agent harness (Hermes).

Run it, don't import it. Hermes spawns this as a stdio MCP server:

    hermes mcp add ot2-complexation \\
        --command uv \\
        --args "run --with mcp --with requests <abs path>/tools/ot2_agent_mcp.py \\
                --base-url http://sdl2-pc-03-cytation.tail6a1dd7.ts.net:8021"

Two deliberate structural choices, both about blast radius:

**It is standalone.** It imports only ``mcp`` and ``requests`` — never
``opentrons_server`` — and reaches the gateway over its public REST API. So it
runs in a throwaway ``uv run --with`` environment and the gateway service venv
is never touched. That matters here more than usual: two live robots share one
checkout and one ``.venv`` on this PC, and adding ``mcp`` there would mean a
stop/sync/start on both (``mcp`` pulls ~10 packages including pywin32).

**It cannot move the robot.** The tool list below is reads plus
propose/revise. There is no approve, execute, or abort tool — not because
they are hidden, but because the gateway refuses them without the claim token,
which lives in the operator's browser and is never given to an agent. Exposing
them would only produce confusing 423s. An agent drafts; a human at
``…/ui/`` reviews, approves, and runs.

The action catalog is fetched from the device at startup
(``GET /plans/actions``) rather than hard-coded, so a gateway that gains an
action or a field does not silently drift from what this advertises.
