.SYNOPSIS
    Exercise the tip lifecycle on real hardware and print the rack at each step.

.DESCRIPTION
    Verifies end-to-end what unit tests can only assert in isolation: that a
    pick marks its origin well `on_pipette` immediately, that the mount records
    where the tip came from, and that returning it restores the well.

    ACTUATES. It moves the head and consumes one tip's worth of pick/return
    cycles. No liquid is aspirated, so the tip comes back clean and the well
    returns to "new" rather than a sample id.

    Prints a plan and stops unless -Run is given.

    Complexation only. It refuses port 8020 outright — ot2_hte runs real
    campaigns and is never a test target.

.PARAMETER ApiKey
    Optional override. Normally omitted: the key is resolved automatically, in
    order, from $env:OT2_API_KEYS then the gateway service's own NSSM
    environment. Claims are login-gated, so some key is required — the point of
    resolving it here is that a hand-pasted one is the step that keeps failing.

    The value is never printed. Only its source and principal name are.

.PARAMETER Service
    NSSM service to read OT2_API_KEYS from. Defaults from -Port.

.PARAMETER Run
    Actually do it. Without this the script only prints what it would do.

.EXAMPLE
    # Look before you leap
    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ot2-tip-lifecycle-check.ps1 -ApiKey KEY

    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ot2-tip-lifecycle-check.ps1 -ApiKey KEY -Run
