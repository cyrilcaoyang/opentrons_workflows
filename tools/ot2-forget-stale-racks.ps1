.SYNOPSIS
    Retire tip-rack entries the tracker still holds for slots that no longer
    carry a tip rack.

.DESCRIPTION
    A rack's identity in the tip store is the deck slot it sits in, so moving a
    rack (or swapping a plate in where one used to be) leaves the old slot
    tracked with tips that are not there. That entry is not inert: an
    unqualified pick_up_tip scans tracked racks in slot order and takes the
    first that is addressable, fits the pipette, and reports a free tip -- and
    a slot declared as a deep-well plate passes all three, because the
    tip-size check parses "_<n>ul" from the load_name and returns TRUE for
    anything it cannot classify (service.py `_rack_fits_pipette`). The head is
    then sent into a plate expecting tips.

    This finds every tracked rack whose slot disagrees with the deck -- nothing
    there, or something there that is not a tip rack -- and marks all of its
    wells `empty` via /control/tips/mark, so `next_available` finds nothing and
    the auto-picker skips it with a stated reason.

    Marking also releases any mount whose tips came from those wells
    (`mark_tips` -> `_forget_mounts_from`, matched on the covered wells rather
    than the mount key), which is how a phantom "N tips on the head" record
    from a rack that is long gone gets cleared.

    METADATA ONLY. No motion, no liquid, no tip touched. It writes the
    tracker's map and one audited `tips_marked` event per slot.

    Prints a plan and stops unless -Run is given.

    Unlike ot2-tip-lifecycle-check.ps1 this does NOT refuse port 8020. That
    refusal exists because *actuating* HTE would collide with real campaigns;
    this script cannot move the robot, and HTE is where tracker drift actually
    has to be repaired. Repairing state is not bench testing.

.PARAMETER Slots
    Optional override: repair exactly these slots instead of the detected set.
    Use when you know the deck is mid-edit and the declaration cannot be
    trusted. Refuses a slot the tracker does not know.

.PARAMETER Status
    What the wells actually hold: `empty` (default -- the rack is gone) or
    `new`. Pass `new` only for a slot whose rack is physically present and
    full, which is not the case this script exists for.

.PARAMETER ApiKey
    Optional override. Normally omitted: the key is resolved automatically, in
    order, from $env:OT2_API_KEYS then the gateway service's own NSSM
    environment. tips/mark is claim-gated and claims are login-gated, so some
    key is required -- the point of resolving it here is that a hand-pasted one
    is the step that keeps failing.

    The value is never printed. Only its source and principal name are.

.PARAMETER Service
    NSSM service to read OT2_API_KEYS from. Defaults from -Port.

.PARAMETER Run
    Actually do it. Without this the script only prints what it would do.
