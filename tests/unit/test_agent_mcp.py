"""The agent-facing MCP surface (``tools/ot2_agent_mcp.py``).

The property worth a regression test is what the surface does *not* have. An
agent's reach must end at the proposal, so a tool that authorizes, runs, or
aborts a plan must never appear here — and it must stay absent as tools are
added later.

`mcp` is a dev-only dependency: the server is standalone and runs in a
throwaway environment spawned by the agent harness, never inside the gateway
service venv (see the script's module docstring).
