"""Persistent per-tiprack tip lifecycle tracking for the OT-2 gateway.

Sits beside :class:`PlateStateStore` / :class:`DeckDeclarationStore` as the third
JSON-backed state store: "which tips on which rack are fresh, used, or gone".
Ported from OT2Demo's driver-level tip tracker, but gateway-owned so it works on
both transports (SSH REPL and the run-engine HTTP path), survives restarts, and
surfaces on ``GET /status`` under ``details.tip_racks``.

Tip status vocabulary (per well):

- ``"new"`` — fresh tip, never used. Absent wells never occur: the map is full.
- ``"empty"`` — tip was dropped to trash; the well has no tip.
- ``"on_pipette"`` — the tip left this well on a pipette head and has not come
  back. Physically a hole, exactly like ``"empty"``, which is why neither is
  pickable and both are droppable-into; the difference is that this hole has a
  tip that may return to it. Written the moment the pick is issued, so a rack
  never claims a tip that is riding the head.
- any other string — a **sample id** the tip has touched (e.g. ``"D_A3"`` or an
  orchestrator sample id). A tip that touched sample X may be re-picked *for
  sample X* (or with ``force=true``), but never silently for another sample —
  that is the cross-contamination guard.

While a tip is off the rack its history is not in the rack map (the well says
only ``"on_pipette"``); it lives on the :class:`~.models.TipMount` for the
pipette holding it, which this store persists beside the racks. That record is
what lets a tip be returned to its own well with its exposure intact — and what
survives the gateway restart that used to strand it.

A pick is tracked per *pipette head*, not per addressed well: an N-channel
pipette sent to a row-A well removes the whole N-well column (see
:func:`covered_well_span`), so ``validate_pick`` / ``next_available`` /
``set_statuses`` all operate on the covered set. ``channels=1`` covers exactly
the addressed well, which is the single-channel behaviour this store has always
had.

``OT2Service`` drives the lifecycle: registration on ``/control/setup``,
validation + auto-pick on ``/control/pick-up-tip``, sample marking after
aspirate/dispense, ``"empty"`` on drop. Refusals raise :class:`TipUnavailable`,
which the API maps to HTTP 412 with the structured body carried on the
exception (STATUS_SPEC §6.1).
