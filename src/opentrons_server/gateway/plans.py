"""Human-approved step lists for agent-proposed OT-2 operation.

An agent (Hermes, `lab-skills`, anything else) may *propose* an ordered list of
control actions. That is the whole of its reach. A human then reviews the
proposal in the operator UI, approves it, and runs it — both of those last two
steps require the device claim, which an agent never holds. This module is that
gate.

**Not a "run authorization".** That term is taken, and the collision is worth
avoiding deliberately: ``ac-organic-lab/docs/AGENTIC_ELN_DESIGN.md`` §12 defines
a *Run Authorization* as a campaign-level gate that pins a merged commit SHA, a
protocol schema version and a compiled-package digest, revalidates inventory and
device readiness, and lands an immutable ``authorization_id`` in AnaliticaDB.

What lives here is a smaller, device-local thing — a **step approval**: one
operator, holding the claim, agreeing to one ad-hoc list of actions on one
robot, for the next few minutes. It governs the work a run authorization does
*not* cover: bring-up, homing, a manual tip pickup, turning the lights off.

The two compose rather than compete — layer 4 decides which validated protocols
may run at all; this decides whether the person at the bench meant to press the
button. Calling both "authorization" would conflate a durable scientific record
with an ephemeral operator gesture in exactly the conversation where the
difference matters.

Why the gate has to live here, in the gateway
---------------------------------------------
The agent harness is a general autonomous system — it has a shell, cron, and
subagents, and it can be driven from a chat app by someone who is nowhere near
the robot. It is therefore not trustworthy as a safety layer, and nothing in
this module assumes it behaves. Every rule below is enforced device-side, on
the only machine that can actually see the deck.

The three rules that make an approval mean something:

1. **The step list is hashed, and the human approves the hash.** Editing any
   step after approval changes the hash and silently voids the approval
   (:meth:`PlanStore.replace_steps`). An agent cannot get approval for a
   harmless plan and then swap the steps.
2. **Approval requires a live claim, and execution requires the *same*
   claim session.** The claim is held by the operator's browser, and its TTL
   only refreshes while that page is heartbeating. So "a human approved
   this" degrades correctly into "a human is still present": if they walk away
   and the claim lapses, the approval dies with it.
3. **Nothing here can approve or start itself.** :meth:`PlanStore.approve`
   takes a ``ClaimedBy`` — an identity the caller cannot mint — and the API
   layer only ever passes one obtained from a real claim. Both ``approve``
   and ``execute`` are claim-gated in ``api.py``, so every path that moves the
   robot begins with a human clicking in the UI. An agent can draft work at
   3am; it cannot start it.

Plans are held in memory on purpose. A claim does not survive a gateway
restart (``claims.ClaimManager``), so an *approval* must not either —
otherwise a restart would leave an approved plan executable with no human
attached to it. Losing a draft on restart is a mild annoyance; keeping a stale
approval is a hazard.
