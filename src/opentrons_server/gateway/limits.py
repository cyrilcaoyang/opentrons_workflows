"""Layer-1 hardware limits for the OT-2.

`INTERLOCKS.md` puts hardware limits in layer 1 and `AGENTS.md` §1 puts layer 1
*here* — "hardware limits in the Pydantic request bodies". STATUS_SPEC §9's
**v1.0** checklist asks for the same thing in so many words: "All control
endpoints under ``/control/*``, gated by Pydantic body schemas with
``Field(ge=, le=)`` ranges." Motion coordinates, well offsets, and pipetting
volumes had none, so an out-of-envelope request reached the robot and failed
mid-motion instead of being refused as a 422 before anything moved.

Two tiers, because not every limit is a constant:

* **Static** — the machine's own envelope. Belongs in the request models as
  ``Field(ge=, le=, description=...)``, which is what makes it *visible*: the
  same JSON schema is what ``/openapi.json`` publishes and what the assistant's
  ``list_actions`` hands the model. A limit written here cannot drift from the
  limit enforced, because they are the same declaration — the argument-range
  analogue of STATUS_SPEC §6.2's "one helper feeds both surfaces".
* **Live** — bounds that depend on what is actually attached or loaded: the
  volume of *this* pipette. Those cannot be schema constants, so they are
  checked before the motion and refused with HTTP 412 and a structured body
  (§6.1), the same shape the tip interlocks use.

Sources, and their honesty:

* X/Y come from ``opentrons_shared_data``'s own OT-2 robot definition
  (``extents``), so they track the package rather than this file.
* **Z does not**: that definition publishes ``extents[2] == 0.0``, i.e. no Z
  travel at all. :data:`MAX_Z_MM` is therefore a documented conservative
  constant, not a measured envelope, and the robot's own rejection remains the
  real backstop. Treat it as "obviously out of range", never as "exactly the
  reachable limit".
* :data:`MAX_WELL_OFFSET_MM` is a **sanity bound on intent**, not a claim about
  the machine. A protocol addresses a well with offsets of single-digit
  millimetres; a 200 mm offset is a mistake in every real protocol, and it is
  the one that prompted this module. Both are env-overridable so a genuine
  outlier is a config change rather than a patch.
